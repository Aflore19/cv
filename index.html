        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my website. I am a self taught web developer coming from a
        previous career in the health sciences. I love to create all kinds of things from
        websites, to crochet blankets, to garden beds full of herbs</p>

          <h3>Design and Development</h3>
          <p class="code_skill_description">I had 4 years of web design classes under my belt by the time I graduated from high school in 2011. Although I knew I could spend hours upon hours in front of a computer working with Dreamweaver and Flash (talk about a throwback) my self confidence at the time and the lack of support for a web development career drove me into the health sciences. I did have a strong interest in human anatomy so I was not upset about the career choice I made. However, After years of working in the health sciences and feeling slightly unfullfilled I decided to change careers and turn something that had always made me happy into my next career. Just like it did in high school, the process of web development truely excites me. </p>

          <h3>Crochet</h3>
          <p class="crochet_skill_description">A recently discoved passion of mine, crochet is the hobby that brings me the most happiness. Just like with
          coding love the process of creating something. Although I tend to mostly create blankts and afghans
          I have dabbled in creating other household items such as baskets and floor mats.</p>
